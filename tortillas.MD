## Ingredients bakers percentages
* AP flour
* 50% hydration
* 15% fat
* 2% salt

## Ingredients grams:

* AP flour: 100g
* Water (Luke warm, 30Â°C): 50g
* Olive oil: 15g
* Salt: 2g

## Instructions:

* In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until the flour reaches a sandy, crumbly consistency (about 1 minute).
* Add the lukewarm water to the mixture and mix well until a shaggy dough forms.
* Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes.
* Add a splash of oil to a clean container, roll the dough in the oil, cover, and let it rest for 10 minutes.
* Divide the dough into 25g pices and roll into balls, lightly oil the balls and cover, let rest for another 10 minutes.
* Dip each ball in flour, ensuring all sides are coated, and lightly flour the surface and rolling pin.
* Press the ball into a disc shape, pinching the sides to thin them out before rolling to help achieve a circular shape.
* Roll out the dough with a rolling pin, rotating it 90 degrees and flipping it often. If the dough becomes sticky, lightly flour the dough on both sides.
* Cook the rolled dough on a medium heat griddle for approximately 90 seconds on the first side and 30 seconds on the second side.
