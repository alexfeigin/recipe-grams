# Leopard Cookies

## Ingredients:
- 100g butter, cubed
- ½ cup cane sugar
- 1 whole egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1¼ cups white spelt flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons milk

### For the marbling:
- 1 teaspoon cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon black cocoa

## Instructions:
1. In a food processor, combine all the ingredients and process just until a uniform dough forms.
2. Remove the dough and separate two small pieces the size of a ping pong ball.
3. Add regular cocoa to one piece and black cocoa to the other, mixing until evenly colored.
4. Shape each piece into a snake of the same size. Leave the lighter cylinder as is and wrap the darker cylinder around about half of the lighter cylinder to create a leopard print effect (see image for example).
5. Roll out the larger dough and arrange the marbled pieces on top.
6. Place parchment paper over it and gently roll together.
7. Use a cookie cutter to create cookies and carefully transfer them to a baking sheet.
8. Bake at 170°C for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
