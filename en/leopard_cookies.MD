# Leopard Print Cookies

## Ingredients:
- 100g butter, cubed
- 100g cane sugar
- 1 whole egg yolk
- 5g vanilla extract
- 150g white spelt flour
- 3g baking powder
- 30g milk

### For the spots:
- 5g cocoa powder
- 5g black cocoa powder

## Instructions:
1. Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until a uniform dough forms.
2. Take two small pieces of dough, each the size of a ping pong ball.
3. Add regular cocoa to one and black cocoa to the other, mixing until evenly colored.
4. Roll each piece into a snake. Leave the lighter snake as is, and wrap the darker one halfway around it to resemble a leopard spot.
5. Roll out the main dough and arrange the "snakes" on top.
6. Place parchment paper on top and gently roll them together.
7. Use a cookie cutter to create cookies and carefully transfer them to a baking sheet.
8. Bake at 170°C for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned.
