# Simple Oven-Baked Schnitzel (Slurry Method)

A quick, no-fry schnitzel recipe using a flour-egg slurry and baked in the oven.

## Ingredients

- 800g Chicken breast thinly sliced
- 2 Large eggs
- 30g all-purpose flour
- 10g salt
- 15g  [grill rub](grill_rub.MD)
- 150g spiced breadcrumbs (store bought, use your favorite, use more as needed to coat thoroughly)
- Olive oil

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 230°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper and lightly brush or spray it with olive oil.
2. In a bowl, whisk together: Eggs, Flour, Salt, Spices. Mix until it forms a thick, sticky batter.
3. Place each chicken slice in the slurry, ensuring it's well coated. 
4. In a shallow dish, place a heap of spiced breadcrumbs.
5. Coat each piece of chicken with breadcrumbs, pressing down to ensure they stick well. Placing each ready slice on the tray.
6. Once breadcrumbs touch the slurry, you need to work fast, the crumbs will start to absorb moisture and become soggy. If you have a lot of chicken, work in smaller 500g batches.
7. Bake for 12–14 minutes total, flipping once around minute 8, until golden and cooked through.
