# Pasta Paprikash

## Ingredients:
- Half a pack of spaghetti (thin pasta recommended)
- Olive oil
- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
- 1 small can of tomato paste
- Granulated garlic
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cayenne pepper or hot paprika (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Cook the pasta until done, drain, and set aside.
2. Heat a little olive oil in a pot.
3. Add sweet paprika, tomato paste, granulated garlic, salt, and pepper. Optionally, add cayenne pepper or hot paprika for a spicy kick.
4. Stir the mixture for a few seconds at the bottom of the pot to develop the flavors.
5. Add the pasta to the pot and mix well with tongs until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.
6. Leave the pasta in the pot for a few more minutes to get a slight crisp, stirring occasionally.

## Note:
For a full pack of pasta, double the amount of sweet paprika, but one can of tomato paste should suffice. You can add a second can for a thicker texture.
