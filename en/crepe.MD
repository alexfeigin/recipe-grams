## Instructions

Recipe adapted from Jacques Pépin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVrRj5pS3sU

I like the consistency of the batter with 300g of liquids. if you like you can start with less and thin it out as needed.

* The point is to have a lukewarm batter so the butter doesn't solidify.
* If the eggs are from the fridge, make the water and milk warmer to compensate. 
* Melt butter in the same frying pan you are going to use for the crêpes.
* In a bowl mix all dry ingredients
* Add the eggs, and start adding some of the liquids (enough to wet the flour)
* Mix well until smooth.
* Mix in the rest of the liquids, and the melted butter and mix until combined.
* Ladle the batter around a hot pan in a thin layer
* Cook until the crêpe starts to dry and edges start to lift, flip and cook for a few seconds.
* After cooking a crêpe it's a good idea to wipe the pan with a paper towel to remove residue, so it will be nonstick for the next one.
