# Sweet and sour carrot salad, a recipe of Dina, Sash's mom

## Ingredients
* 1 kilogram of carrots, cut into matchsticks

### For the dressing:
* ½ cup of neutral-flavored vegetable oil (grape seed/canola/other)
* ½ cup of white vinegar
* 3 tablespoons of sugar
* 2-3 crushed garlic cloves
* ½ teaspoon flat salt

* Chopped chives to taste
* 150 grams of chopped candied pecans

## Instructions:
1. In a shaker, mix all the dressing ingredients well, drizzle over the carrots, and mix thoroughly. Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before serving; the flavors improve over time and can be prepared a few hours in advance.
2. Before serving, mix everything together with the chives and pecans.
