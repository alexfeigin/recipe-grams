# Salt

Salting your food properly is essential for both flavor and texture.  
When considering how much salt to add to your food, a good guideline is to use between **0.8–1.2%** of the total weight of the food. I personally like to use **1%**.

Keep in mind that for baking, when you base the percentage of salt on the weight of the flour, the final salt level can change depending on the dough's hydration. You don’t base it on the weight of the total dough either, because it will lose water during baking.

A good rule of thumb (if you don't have a recipe) is to assume that the finished baked product will have **35% hydration**.  
So, use the formula:  
**Weight of flour × 1.35 = estimated final weight**  
Then calculate **0.8–1.2%** of that for salt.

Some doughs are expected to be saltier. For a **pizza Margherita**, I like to use **1.8%** salt. The salt enhances the flavor of mozzarella cheese, which can be bland without it.

If you're using already-salted ingredients—like salted butter, cheese, or soy sauce—you’ll need to adjust the amount of added salt accordingly. Sometimes the best method is to simply taste and adjust.

When working with things that are unsafe to taste raw, like ground meat, you can cook a small sample in the microwave to check seasoning. For minced meat, microwaving a spoonful on a microwave-safe dish for about 30 seconds is usually enough to cook it through. Then you can taste it and adjust the seasoning for the rest of the batch.
