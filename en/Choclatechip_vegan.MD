# Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients:
- 110g coconut oil or canola oil
- 90g white or brown sugar
- 60g plant-based milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 210g white or whole spelt flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- Pinch of salt
- 100g dark chocolate chips

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, whisk the oil and sugar until well combined.
3. Add the plant-based milk and vanilla, and whisk again to combine the ingredients.
4. Add the flour and baking soda, then mix with a spatula or spoon until a smooth, sticky dough forms with the texture of soft clay.
5. Fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Use a spoon to form cookie shapes and arrange them on the tray, leaving space between each.
7. Bake for 12-13 minutes until the cookies are set and slightly cracked on top. They will be soft but will firm up after cooling.
