# Purple Cabbage Salad a Recipe of Dina, Sash's mom

## Ingredients
* 1 head of purple cabbage, sliced into thin strips

### For the dressing:
* ½ cup neutral-flavored vegetable oil (grape seed/canola/other)
* ½ cup Japanese-style soy sauce (Kikkoman/Yamasa)
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* ½ teaspoon flat salt

* 100 grams pine nuts
* 100 grams white sesame seeds
* 100 grams shelled sunflower seeds

## Instructions:
1. In a shaker, mix all the dressing ingredients well, drizzle over the cabbage, and mix thoroughly. Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before serving; the flavors improve over time and can be prepared a few hours in advance.
2. In a dry non-stick pan, toast the sesame seeds, sunflower seeds separately, and the pine nuts separately until they all start to brown and smell fragrant. Spread them out on a flat plate to cool.
3. Before serving, mix everything together with the pine nuts, sesame seeds, and seeds.
